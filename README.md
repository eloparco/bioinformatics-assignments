# Bioinformatics Assignments

My solutions to the assignments for the *Bioinformatics* course, in particular to the genomic labs.

Each folder contains the text of the lab and the proposed solution in Python. 

## Summary
Topics of the labs:
1. Basic operations on genomics data (random FASTA file generator, statistic extraction, FASTA files comparison) and consensus regions
2. Global and local alignment using dynamic programming
3. Search for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and deletions;  
Raw read count for protein-coding genes
4. T-test for differential gene expression analysis;  
Classifier for Luminal A / Luminal B breast cancer subtypes using gene expression data
